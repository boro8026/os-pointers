C / C++ Pointers

The goal of this program is to gather certain information about a student. This includes the student's id number, the student's first and last name, how many of the students assignments have been graded, and the the score of each of those assignments. After collecting all of this information, the average grade (rounded to a single decimal point) will be calculated. All of this information will then be outputted nicely to the user.
